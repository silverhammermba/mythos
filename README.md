# Eldritch Horror Mythos Companion #

Saves you the effort of setting up the Mythos deck in Eldritch Horror. The live
site is [here](https://silverhammermba.github.io/mythos/).

## Installation ##

It's a static website; just throw it in your web server's root. Or just clone it
and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Images ##

I get my card images from Tabletop Simulator Workshop mods. Once you have the
mod installed, you can find the images in

    ~/.local/share/Tabletop Simulator/Mods/Images
